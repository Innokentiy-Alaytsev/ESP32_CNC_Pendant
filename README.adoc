# Intro 

I have a Creality Ender 3 3D printer and when I need to print anything, I constantly have to pull SD card from the printer, stick it into PC, copy files, pull from PC, stick into printer, wash, rinse, repeat. 
That operations add add mechanical wear to uSD cards, slots, not to mention they  waste time and take some fun away from 3D printing.
I've tried Octoprint and a Raspberry Pi connected to a printer, but 1) there is no control over Octoprint without connected PC (and I want autonomous printing) and 2) it boots for almost a minute!

Also, I have a chineese 3018 CNC device with a laser, for which I need a CNC pendant for manually moving laser to stock zero position.
This might be solved via a joystick and specialized PC software (since my CNC jobs are short and connecting PC is not problem), but having a CNC pendant felt way cooler.

So I started this project to make follwoing usecases possible:

* Connect a pendant to 3D printer, upload files to it over WiFi, then print autonomously, without the need for PC. Usual Marlin-level interface should be available for Z-babystepping, feedrate adjustment, pause/stop, filament change etc.
** 3D printer firmware: Marlin.
** Bonus: octoprint interface for controlling the print from PC.

* Connect a pendant to a CNC machine for DRO (digital read-out), easy jogging, setting center of working coordinates. Then either upload a file via WiFi and machine from pendant, or send gcode via WiFi to machine via pendant.
** CNC firmware: GRBL.

* Bonus: Bluetooth serial prifile for gcode streaming.


This project is inspired by https://github.com/probonopd/WirelessPrinting[WirelessPrinting] (3D printing part), 
https://github.com/drandrewthomas/ESP32_GRBL_CNC_Wireless_Pendant[ESP32 GRBL Wireless Pendant] (CNC part) with some ideas from https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs[cncjs].

The full project consists of a ESP32 firmware, a rudimentary schematic for electronics and a case. 

This repo contains the firmware sourcecode.
It written with Arduino framekwork, to be built by PlatformIO system.
This is for ease of adoption of the project by a community. 

The electronics would use widely available cheap components, schematic would be created _ad-hoc_, no complex circuitry is expected.

The case is modeled in Fusion 360 and will be published on thingiverse once prototypes are working.

## Features and specification:

**At the moment, this is more of a TODO-list!**


* [x] Connection to device via UART (I've considered USB in USB-host mode, but it requires battery circuitry since printer won't power the pendant via USB)

* [x] Autodetection of device firmware: Marlin/grbl. Seems to be working

* [x] uSD card for storing files

* [x] WiFi
** [x] Uploading files to ESP32 from PC (Octoprint interface, rudimentary Web interface)
** [ ] Direct TCP/IP to UART bridge

* [v] User interace (quick'n'dirty implementation works)
** LCD, Jog wheel, buttons, axis selector, multiplier selector
** 2 main UI modes:
*** Jogging and DRO
*** Printing from a file. Includes a file browser and printing status window a-la Marlin LCD interface.

* [ ] Settings window for connecting to a WiFi network etc (this idea might be dropped since entering WiFi password would be a pain).

# BOM

* ESP32 module. 
  I used Lolin32 board. NodeMCU and Lolin D32 should work as well
* An encoder handwheel. 
  I used a 3D-printed wheel on top of a popular 30 ppr quadrature encoder. 
  Handwheel can be dwnloaded here: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4539825
  Commercial handwheels will work even better. 
* 2 potentiometers (20K) as jog axis selector and jog multiplier selector. 
  Clicking apparatus added via 3D-printed knobs.
* 128x64 LCD based on ST7920 chip with SPI interface. 
  It's the same as in 3D printers.

* MicroSD slot (I used a shield for Wemos D1 Mini boards, but any will do)
* Buttons (I have not decided on quantity yet)
* 2 resistors or level shifter for 5V UART
* Might be needed: level shifter for 5V LCD, diode+resistor for LCD SPI bugfix
* wires, cable, connector for 3D printer and CNC boards 

* Case.
  Building of the case, with 3D files, is described here
